    //Conceptual Overview - Classes and Objects in java

    //What are objects?
    //Objects are anything that you see around you
    //Every object has a state and a behaviour
    //Example:
    //If we consider a person as an example states of the person will be:
    //1. Complexion 2. Height 3. Weight 4. Height 5. Eyes color

    //Similarly, the behaviour would be:
    //1. walking 2. laughing 3. crying 4. running

    //Objects can be instances of a class in java
    //Objects have state and behavior

    //What are classes?
    //A class is nothing but a blueprint to define an object
    //Classes will define all the state and behaviour that you wish the objects to have
    //Classes are also known as user defined data type in java

    //Why do we need classes and objects in java?
    //1. java offers primitive data types which can be used normally but if you need something custom that is when classes and objects come into the picture
    //2. Java also offers an easy way to simulate real world scenarios with the help of classes in java

    //Here is an example of user class with certain state and behaviour
    //Classes can also contain
    //1. Variables
    //2. Methods
    //3. Interfaces
    //4. Member Class
    //5. Constructors


    //New keyword allocation in java
    //What happens when you create a variable?
    // Lets say you've declared a variable "a" as an integer for use in your program. When you do so , java compiler allocates memory space corresponding to 4 bytes of space. (Size of integer = 4 bytes) and allocates it to the variable you have just declared

    //Whenever you assign a value to this variable it sits in this memory block

    //Objects creation in java has two types
    //1. Object declaration
    //syntax: class-name object-name; e.g scanner sc
    //here an object is declared and a reference variable is created in memory. However, memory allocation

    //2. Object creation and memory allocation
    //syntax: object-name = new class-name
    //Here memory for the declared object is created using a new operator
    //Objects can only be used after memory is allocated to them.
    //You can not use objects without allocating them memory otherwise the compiler will throw an error.
