Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit

The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:

declare class variables/attributes as private
provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user

Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
