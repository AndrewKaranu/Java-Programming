    //Always remember:
    //It is not recommended to have multiple classes in a single java file as it will affect readability and is not a good programming practice

    //For example if I want to create 500 classes in java for a project and if I declare all my classes in a single file, imagine the length of the file and the clutter it will have.

    //It would be difficult for a programmer to navigate through the file and make appropriate changes. If you are working in a team of engineers who are working on the same projects, it would make it very difficult to collaborate. Hence, it is always recommended to declare multiple classes in  multiple files.

    //This approach ames it easier rto find relevant code and helps improve readability and maintainability.

    // What are packages?

    //Package is nothing but a group of related classes, interfaces and other packages. Packages help developers organise classes and interfaces in java.

    //There are two types of packages in java:

    //User defined packages are packages which are created and defined by the user:
    //For example, you are working on software for a loan providing company, you could create packages to group similar classes. Like you can create a package for storing home loan classes, a different package for car loan

    //System defined packages in java: System defined packages are packages which are built into a system with ready-made classes. These packages come along with the JDK to simplify the task of programmers. Some of the commonly used built-in packages are in java.lang, java.io, java.util, java.applet etc. For example, the scanner class which you use to read
